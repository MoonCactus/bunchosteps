// This file contains compile-time configurations for Grbl's internal system. For the most part,
// users will not need to directly modify these, but they are here for specific needs, i.e.
// performance tuning or adjusting to non-typical machines.

// IMPORTANT: Any changes here requires a full re-compiling of the source code to propagate them.

#ifndef config_h
#define config_h

// Serial baud rate
#define BAUD_RATE 115200

// Default cpu mappings. Grbl officially supports the Arduino Uno only. Other processor types
// may exist from user-supplied templates or directly user-defined in cpu_map.h
#define CPU_MAP_ATMEGA328P // Arduino Uno CPU

// Number of floating decimal points printed by Grbl for certain value types. These settings are 
// determined by realistic and commonly observed values in CNC machines. For example, position
// values cannot be less than 0.001mm or 0.0001in, because machines can not be physically more
// precise this. So, there is likely no need to change these, but you can if you need to here.
// NOTE: Must be an integer value from 0 to ~4. More than 4 may exhibit round-off errors.
#define N_DECIMAL_COORDVALUE_MM   3 // Coordinate or position value in mm
#define N_DECIMAL_RATEVALUE_MM    0 // Rate or velocity value in mm/min
#define N_DECIMAL_SETTINGVALUE    3 // Decimals for floating point setting values

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ADVANCED CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:

// Sets the maximum step rate allowed to be written as a Grbl setting. This option enables an error 
// check in the settings module to prevent settings values that will exceed this limitation. The maximum
// step rate is strictly limited by the CPU speed and will change if something other than an AVR running
// at 16MHz is used.
// NOTE: For now disabled, will enable if flash space permits.
// #define MAX_STEP_RATE_HZ 30000 // Hz

// Creates a delay between the direction pin setting and corresponding step pulse by creating
// another interrupt (Timer2 compare) to manage it. The main Grbl interrupt (Timer1 compare) 
// sets the direction pins, and does not immediately set the stepper pins, as it would in 
// normal operation. The Timer2 compare fires next to set the stepper pins after the step 
// pulse delay time, and Timer2 overflow will complete the step pulse, except now delayed 
// by the step pulse time plus the step pulse delay. (Thanks langwadt for the idea!)
// NOTE: Uncomment to enable. The recommended delay must be > 3us, and, when added with the
// user-supplied step pulse time, the total time must not exceed 127us. Reported successful
// values for certain setups have ranged from 5 to 20us.
// #define STEP_PULSE_DELAY 10 // Step pulse delay in microseconds. Default disabled.

// Line buffer size from the serial input stream to be executed. Also, governs the size of 
// each of the startup blocks, as they are each stored as a string of this size. Make sure
// to account for the available EEPROM at the defined memory address in settings.h and for
// the number of desired startup blocks.
// NOTE: 80 characters is not a problem except for extreme cases, but the line buffer size 
// can be too small and g-code blocks can get truncated. Officially, the g-code standards 
// support up to 256 characters. In future versions, this default will be increased, when 
// we know how much extra memory space we can re-invest into this.
// #define LINE_BUFFER_SIZE 80  // Uncomment to override default in protocol.h
  
// Serial send and receive buffer size. The receive buffer is often used as another streaming
// buffer to store incoming blocks to be processed by Grbl when its ready. Most streaming
// interfaces will character count and track each block send to each block response. So, 
// increase the receive buffer if a deeper receive buffer is needed for streaming and avaiable
// memory allows. The send buffer primarily handles messages in Grbl. Only increase if large
// messages are sent and Grbl begins to stall, waiting to send the rest of the message.
// NOTE: Buffer size values must be greater than zero and less than 256.
// #define RX_BUFFER_SIZE 128 // Uncomment to override defaults in serial.h
// #define TX_BUFFER_SIZE 64
  
// Toggles XON/XOFF software flow control for serial communications. Not officially supported
// due to problems involving the Atmega8U2 USB-to-serial chips on current Arduinos. The firmware
// on these chips do not support XON/XOFF flow control characters and the intermediate buffer 
// in the chips cause latency and overflow problems with standard terminal programs. However, 
// using specifically-programmed UI's to manage this latency problem has been confirmed to work.
// As well as, older FTDI FT232RL-based Arduinos(Duemilanove) are known to work with standard
// terminal programs since their firmware correctly manage these XON/XOFF characters. In any
// case, please report any successes to grbl administrators!
// #define ENABLE_XONXOFF // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.

// A simple software debouncing feature for hard limit switches. When enabled, the interrupt 
// monitoring the hard limit switch pins will enable the Arduino's watchdog timer to re-check 
// the limit pin state after a delay of about 32msec. This can help with CNC machines with 
// problematic false triggering of their hard limit switches, but it WILL NOT fix issues with 
// electrical interference on the signal cables from external sources. It's recommended to first
// use shielded signal cables with their shielding connected to ground (old USB/computer cables 
// work well and are cheap to find) and wire in a low-pass circuit into each limit pin.
// #define ENABLE_SOFTWARE_DEBOUNCE // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.

// Force Grbl to check the state of the hard limit switches when the processor detects a pin
// change inside the hard limit ISR routine. By default, Grbl will trigger the hard limits
// alarm upon any pin change, since bouncing switches can cause a state check like this to 
// misread the pin. When hard limits are triggered, they should be 100% reliable, which is the
// reason that this option is disabled by default. Only if your system/electronics can guarantee
// that the switches don't bounce, we recommend enabling this option. This will help prevent
// triggering a hard limit when the machine disengages from the switch.
// NOTE: This option has no effect if SOFTWARE_DEBOUNCE is enabled.
// #define HARD_LIMIT_FORCE_STATE_CHECK // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.
