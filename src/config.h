// This file contains compile-time configurations for Grbl's internal system. For the most part,
// users will not need to directly modify these, but they are here for specific needs, i.e.
// performance tuning or adjusting to non-typical machines.

// IMPORTANT: Any changes here requires a full re-compiling of the source code to propagate them.

// Default cpu mappings. Grbl officially supports the Arduino Uno only. Other processor types
// may exist from user-supplied templates or directly user-defined in cpu_map.h

// Auto-switch to external when receiving pulses

// Number of floating decimal points printed by Grbl for certain value types. These settings are 
// determined by realistic and commonly observed values in CNC machines. For example, position
// values cannot be less than 0.001mm or 0.0001in, because machines can not be physically more
// precise this. So, there is likely no need to change these, but you can if you need to here.
// NOTE: Must be an integer value from 0 to ~4. More than 4 may exhibit round-off errors.
#define N_DECIMAL_COORDVALUE_MM   3 // Coordinate or position value in mm
#define N_DECIMAL_RATEVALUE_MM    0 // Rate or velocity value in mm/min
#define N_DECIMAL_SETTINGVALUE    3 // Decimals for floating point setting values

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ADVANCED CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:

// Serial send and receive buffer size. The receive buffer is often used as another streaming
// buffer to store incoming blocks to be processed by Grbl when its ready. Most streaming
// interfaces will character count and track each block send to each block response. So, 
// increase the receive buffer if a deeper receive buffer is needed for streaming and avaiable
// memory allows. The send buffer primarily handles messages in Grbl. Only increase if large
// messages are sent and Grbl begins to stall, waiting to send the rest of the message.
// NOTE: Buffer size values must be greater than zero and less than 256.
// #define RX_BUFFER_SIZE 128 // Uncomment to override defaults in serial.h
// #define TX_BUFFER_SIZE 64
  
// Toggles XON/XOFF software flow control for serial communications. Not officially supported
// due to problems involving the Atmega8U2 USB-to-serial chips on current Arduinos. The firmware
// on these chips do not support XON/XOFF flow control characters and the intermediate buffer 
// in the chips cause latency and overflow problems with standard terminal programs. However, 
// using specifically-programmed UI's to manage this latency problem has been confirmed to work.
// As well as, older FTDI FT232RL-based Arduinos(Duemilanove) are known to work with standard
// terminal programs since their firmware correctly manage these XON/XOFF characters. In any
// case, please report any successes to grbl administrators!
// #define ENABLE_XONXOFF // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.
